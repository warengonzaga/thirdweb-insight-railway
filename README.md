## Template

This is the **official community Railway template** for [thirdweb Insight](https://thirdweb.com/insight) maintained by the thirdweb community team. This template deploys [thirdweb Insight](https://hub.docker.com/r/thirdweb/insight), lets you retrieve blockchain data from any EVM chain, enrich it with metadata, and transform it using custom logic. This template also deploys a modified [Clickhouse Server](https://github.com/warengonzaga/thirdweb-insight-railway) database to create pre-defined tables for Insight to store data.

## Overview
