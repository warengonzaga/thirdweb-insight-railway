## Template

This is the **official community Railway template** for [thirdweb Insight](https://thirdweb.com/insight) maintained by the thirdweb community team. This template deploys [thirdweb Insight](https://hub.docker.com/r/thirdweb/insight), lets you retrieve blockchain data from any EVM chain, enrich it with metadata, and transform it using custom logic. This template also deploys a modified [Clickhouse Server](https://github.com/warengonzaga/thirdweb-insight-clickhouse-railway) database to create pre-defined tables for Insight to store data.

### Requirements

- [Custom Clickhouse Server](https://github.com/warengonzaga/thirdweb-insight-clickhouse-railway) (v24.11+)
- thirdweb API Client. [[Get it here](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)]
- RPC URL of the blockchain you want to index. [[Get it here](https://thirdweb.com/chains)]

## Overview

Insight is a powerful tool that lets you retrieve blockchain data from any EVM chain, enrich it with metadata, and transform it using custom logic.
